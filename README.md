Final Team Project for Applied Data Mining ADS-502

## Summary
Forming a basic understanding of the dataset with EDA and visualization to identify patterns. Establish which descriptive features are informative in predicting the total payment made in selected geographic region at a given time period. To explore the linear relationships between the predictor and target variable payments, linear regression, decision trees, and random forest machine learning algorithms will be explored. The better performing model will be further utilized to improve predictive capabilities through feature selection.

## Objective
Identifying patterns or anomalies indicative of fraud, waste, or abuse.
